# Guide ideas

Backlog of guide/tool ideas for this repo, not part of the live site. When one is
ready to build, it'll likely become its own page (like `hunt-for-astronomy.html` or
`jump-puzzle-macros.html`) and get linked from `index.html`.

Format per idea: a short pitch, then notes on scope and data sources.

## Trade-in mount cost/value guide

Cover every mount obtained by trading in items (tribal quest currencies, tomestones,
Bozjan/Zadnor, Island Sanctuary, seasonal event currencies, Doman Mahjong, etc.), and
for each one:

- How to obtain it (which currency/items, where to turn them in).
- Whether the required trade-in items are marketboardable, and if so their live
  Universalis price.
- Whether the mount itself is ever resellable (most aren't; a few limited cases might
  be, worth double-checking per mount rather than assuming).

Goal: let someone compare "grind it out" vs "buy the mats off the board" vs (rare
cases) "just buy the mount," using live prices rather than a static gil estimate that
goes stale.

Notes:
- This will need live market data (Universalis API), so it's more of a small
  interactive tool than a static markdown/HTML guide, similar in spirit to a
  mini-calculator page rather than a plain link list entry.
- Data-gathering will need a mount-by-mount pass (source: item(s)/currency needed,
  vendor/turn-in NPC, item marketboardability) before any UI work starts. The wiki is
  the source of truth for this, per the existing convention of re-verifying item
  sources against the wiki rather than Teamcraft.
- **Decided:** currently-obtainable mounts only. Permanently unavailable
  seasonal/collab/promo mounts are excluded from the full data-gathering pass.
- **Decided:** where both the trade-in currency and the finished mount item are
  marketboardable, the "grind vs. buy mats vs. buy mount" verdict is computed live
  from whatever prices are currently loaded (see `computeVerdict()` in
  `trade-in-mounts.html`), not hardcoded at research time — a verdict based on a
  price snapshot would silently go wrong as prices move. Verdicts are only
  hardcoded when they're a structural fact (e.g. neither side is marketable, so
  it's grind-only regardless of price).

**Research note (structural finding from later research, applies to every idea
below):** the mounts guide only produces a real "buy vs. grind" comparison when the
trade-in currency itself is a tradeable voucher/token (Bicolor Gemstone Voucher,
Turali Bicolor Gemstone Voucher, seasonal event tokens). Raw bound tribal-quest
currencies, Bozjan Mettle, Island Sanctuary's Seafarer's Cowrie, and MGP are all
confirmed never marketboardable, so any entry funded purely by one of those
collapses to "grind only," same as the Marid pilot case. Fertile ground for new
guides is specifically the rest of what the Bicolor Gemstone Voucher vendors
(Edelina in Mor Dhona, and the Dawntrail Turali equivalent) sell: mounts aren't the
only thing on that list.

## Trade-in minions guide

Direct sibling to the mount guide, same shape: minions unlocked by trading in
tribal-quest currency, tomestones, Bicolor Gemstone Vouchers, or seasonal tokens,
compared live against buying the mats vs. (rarely) the minion itself.

**Top candidate to build next**: reuses `trade-in-mounts.html`'s architecture
almost as-is (`costForQty`, `computeVerdict`, `computeSavings`, order-book walk), and
for the voucher-funded minions specifically, the same currency IDs the mounts page
already fetches and caches (Bicolor Gemstone Voucher 35833, Turali Bicolor Gemstone
Voucher 43961).

Notes:
- Currently-obtainable minions only, same exclusion rule as mounts.
- Data source: Console Games Wiki minion pages, cross-checked against
  `ffxivcollect.com/minions` for enumeration and acquisition-method tagging (wiki is
  still the source of truth per this project's sourcing rule; ffxivcollect is just
  for finding the full list to check against).
- Likely a bigger list than mounts, since minions are a larger collectible category
  overall, so this probably needs the same "verify one pilot end-to-end before
  scaling" approach used for the mounts guide.
- Open question: whether to share a price cache with `trade-in-mounts.html` for the
  overlapping voucher currencies (mirrors the `market-region.js` sharing decision
  already made for DC/region preference), or keep the two pages fully independent.

## Trade-in orchestrion rolls guide

Rolls purchased with Bicolor Gemstone Vouchers or seasonal tokens, compared against
the roll's own marketboard price where the roll itself is also tradeable. Orchestrion
rolls hit the "just buy the finished item" branch more often than mounts do, since
rolls are commonly resellable themselves.

Notes:
- Second priority after minions.
- Data source: `thonky.com`'s orchestrion roll list and `ffxivcollect.com/orchestrions`
  both tag acquisition method (gil vendor, quest, dungeon/raid drop, crafted,
  gemstone vendor, MGP), so this needs a filtering pass to isolate just the
  currency-funded subset, since a large fraction are plain gil-vendor purchases (no
  tradeoff at all) or raid/dungeon drops.
- **Risk:** no reliable, authoritative per-run drop rate exists for the raid/dungeon-
  drop rolls, so the "grind cost" side can't be computed as a number for those.
  They'd need a qualitative note instead, or exclusion from the guide entirely.

## Trade-in chocobo barding guide

Smaller, cleaner category: barding sold via Achievement Certificates, Tomestones of
Allegory, Skybuilders' Scrips (Ishgardian Restoration), and MGP.

Notes:
- Smallest item count of the three new ideas (dozens, not hundreds), a good size
  for a second pilot if minions turns out to be too large to tackle in one pass.
- Most of the funding currencies here are likely bound (Achievement Certificates,
  MGP). Skybuilders' Scrip marketability specifically is unconfirmed and needs
  checking before this is worth building; if it's bound too, most of this list is
  "grind only" like the Marid pilot case, which is a much weaker guide.

## Recurring player questions without a good existing guide

Broader sweep, not limited to the buy-vs-grind mechanic above: what do people keep
asking on forums that no clear guide answers well today. Sourced from official forum
sticky/FAQ threads and independent guide sites, cross-checked to rule out topics
that already have solid coverage elsewhere. Methodology caveat: direct Reddit access
wasn't available for this pass (fetching reddit.com was blocked, and the search
backend wasn't indexing Reddit threads), so "frequency" below is triangulated from
proxies instead: an official sticky FAQ thread's existence and contents, independent
guide sites converging on the same question set, and forum posts explicitly asking
because no answer exists yet. Worth a real Reddit-inclusive pass later if a tool
with better forum access becomes available.

### Inventory / retainer decluttering guide

Pitch: a curated, opinionated list of what to actually keep vs. discard, this is
junk, this is a hidden trap, this needs bank space regardless.

- **Top pick of this batch.** Barely any existing coverage. Clearest evidence: a
  Square Enix forum thread literally titled
  ["Request: Inventory Management Tips from Vets"](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/364479),
  players asking other players because no comprehensive answer exists anywhere.
- Fits this site's personal/opinionated style well, same spirit as
  `jump-puzzle-macros.html`'s personal-tips angle, rather than a wiki clone.
- Risk: subjective by nature, and needs light revision as new inventory features
  ship (Chocobo Saddlebag, expansions adding storage).

### "What new players actually ask" page

Pitch: a tight, current, curated FAQ page, not another sprawling wiki-style list.

- Evidence: two independent sources converge on nearly the same question set: the
  official sticky
  ["Sprout FAQs"](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/495303-Sprout-FAQs)
  (dyeing gear, aggro, Party Finder/Unsync, healer boredom, marketboard basics,
  extreme queues not popping, glamour dresser, DC travel, GC promotion) and
  [MMORPG.com's new-player FAQ](https://www.mmorpg.com/guides/final-fantasy-xiv-common-new-player-questions-2000120181)
  (iLvl, melding, Limit Break, tomestones, Golden Saucer, flying, beast tribes). The
  sticky thread's existence is itself frequency evidence.
- Gap is partial: scattered coverage already exists (MMORPG.com, Moonieverse,
  Trials of Fantasy), so the value-add here is curation and staying current, not
  filling a void.

### Retainer venture optimization (gearing vs. quick venture, when to switch)

- Already covered by Console Games Wiki, Teamcraft, and RPGSite, but a GameFAQs
  thread and forum posts still call it confusing, so the real opportunity is a
  tighter decision tool, not new territory.
- Lower priority than the two above since coverage already exists, just not in a
  decision-tool format.

### Currency cap/expiry tracker: "what's about to go to waste"

- Evidence: [TheGamer's tomestone-cycle-exchange piece](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-14-xiv-allagan-tomestones-cycle-exchange-explained/)
  confirms this is real, recurring, seasonal confusion every time tomestone tiers
  rotate.
- Best suited as a live/interactive tool rather than a static article: this would
  reuse the currency-tracking groundwork already built for the mounts guide, rather
  than needing new architecture.
- Risk: needs upkeep every patch cycle when tomestone tiers rotate, similar
  maintenance shape to the beast-tribe/tomestone data in `hunt-for-astronomy.html`.

## Ideas considered and ruled out

Recorded so these don't get re-researched later:

- **Triple Triad cards**: confirmed not marketboard-tradeable at all (only
  sellable to an NPC for MGP, and MGP can't be spent on the marketboard either).
  There's no "buy" side to compare against, so no guide is possible in this shape.
- **Doman Mahjong shop**: just another MGP-reward system, not a distinct tradeable
  currency. Folds into the general MGP problem below rather than being its own
  guide.
- **Gold Saucer MGP items broadly**: MGP itself is never gil-buyable, so the "buy
  the mats" side of the comparison doesn't exist. The only occasional tradeoff is
  "grind MGP vs. buy the rare marketboard-tradeable exception" (e.g. Sabotender
  Emperador, Pod 602), which is too sparse and inconsistent across items to carry a
  whole guide. Better as a footnote callout inside the mounts/minions guides than
  its own page.
- **Housing furnishings**: a real buy-vs-grind tradeoff exists (crafted/vendor/
  gemstone-bought vs. marketboard) but the item count is enormous and heavily
  overlaps with the "framing kits" already sold by the gemstone vendor. Worth
  revisiting as a much bigger future project, not a near-term pick.
- **Materia melding/breakpoints**: already well served by xivgear.app and
  Teamcraft's gearset calculators, which solve this as an actual calculator rather
  than a written guide. Would just duplicate existing tools.
- **Housing lottery mechanics**: five or more major press explainers already cover
  this clearly (Inverse, PC Gamer, Destructoid, TechRaptor, ScreenRant).
- **Deep Dungeon mechanics (Palace of the Dead/Heaven-on-High/Eureka Orthos)**:
  well covered by Icy Veins, the Console Games Wiki, ESTNN, and GameRant.
- **Ocean Fishing scoring**: well covered by Icy Veins, Teamcraft, Fieldcraft, and
  a detailed community forum guide.
- **Job unlock order**: covered by TheGamer, GamesRadar, Destructoid, FFXIV Guild,
  and Sportskeeda, all with current lists. Also goes stale every expansion, so
  high maintenance for low differentiation versus existing coverage.
- **Beast tribe reputation mechanics**: covered by the wiki plus Icy Veins'
  per-tribe pages.
- **Weekly tomestone cap/augmented gear**: covered clearly by Icy Veins' Dawntrail
  gearing guide.
- **Free Company vs. static vs. raid group**: answered informally across many
  threads already, and it's too subjective/social a topic for a factual guide
  format to add much.
