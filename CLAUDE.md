# Project conventions

## Commit messages

Never include `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` or `Claude-Session: ...` trailers, or any
other Claude/AI attribution, in commits to this repo. Commits should carry only the
user's authorship.

## Writing style

Never use em dashes (—) in site copy, README text, or commit messages. Use a period,
comma, colon, or parentheses instead, whatever reads most naturally for the sentence.

## Translations

The site is localized into English, Japanese, German, and French (see `i18n.js` and
`i18n/*.json`, and the "Translations" section of README.md for the mechanics). When
adding a new tool `<li>` to `index.html`, `plugins.html`, or `watchlist.html`, add its
description to `i18n/en.json`'s `items` object under a unique slug and set
`data-i18n="items.<slug>"` on the `.desc` span, then add matching entries to
`ja.json`, `de.json`, and `fr.json` at the same time rather than leaving them for
later. A missing key falls back to English automatically, so the site won't break if
a translation is skipped, but the intent is to keep the site fully translated, not to
accumulate an English-only backlog. Flag any uncertain in-game terminology (Housing,
Glamour, Retainer, and similar systems have specific localized terms) for review
rather than guessing silently.

## Checking whether a Dalamud plugin needs the `experimental` tag

`plugins.html` tags any plugin not in Dalamud's default plugin directory as
`experimental` (see README.md's "Three pages" section). To check which applies to a
given plugin without asking the user:

- The Dalamud Plugin Browser (https://tommadness.github.io/Plugin-Browser/) is a
  client-rendered SPA, so fetching its HTML directly returns an empty shell, not the
  plugin list.
- Its `data.json` (https://tommadness.github.io/Plugin-Browser/data.json) points to
  the real data source: `pluginMasterUrl` = `https://kamori.goats.dev/Plugin/PluginMaster`,
  the official live Dalamud plugin master list.
- Fetch that JSON directly (`curl -s https://kamori.goats.dev/Plugin/PluginMaster`)
  and search by `Name`/`InternalName`. A match with a real entry (has a `RepoUrl`,
  `DownloadLinkInstall`, etc.) means it's in the default repo, no `experimental` tag.
- Watch for `"IsHide": true` on a matched entry: that plugin is hidden from in-game
  browsing (won't show up scrolling the list) but is still in the default repo, so it
  doesn't need `experimental`; just note in the description that the user needs to
  search the exact plugin name to find/install it.
- `data.json`'s `adoptable`/`stale`/`discontinued`/`obsolete` arrays are also useful
  context if a plugin looks abandoned.
